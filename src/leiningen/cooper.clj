(defn  ^:no-project-needed cooper
  "Combine multiple long runnning processes and pipe their output and error
   streams to `stdout` in a distinctive manner.

   Cooper follows the standard set out by Rubys Foreman gem and processes are
   defined in a Procfile at the root of the project.  Each line is a process
   name and related command.  A sample Procfile looks like this,

       web: lein ring server
       jsx: jsx --watch src/ build/

   This example defines 2 processes web and jsx.

   - web runs the ring server
   - jsx runs the react.js precompiler in auto compile mode.

   This avoids having to manage checking on multiple windows and checking their
   output.

   **CAUTION**

   The JVM is super pants at managing external processes which means that when
   a processes dies and cooper attempts to kill the other processes there may
   be some processes left running.  This is due to the fact that when the JVM
   kills processes it wont kill child process of that process.  There is also
   no cross paltform way to get a handle on child processes and kill them.

   However this is only an issue when a process fails.  When you manually
   CTRL-C out of the lein cooper command everything will be shutdown as
   expected so this issue only happens in an error case."
